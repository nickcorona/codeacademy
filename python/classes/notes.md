## Methods

* Methods are functions defined part of a class.
* First argument in method is the object calling the method.
Usually called 'self', by convention.

## Constructors

* __init__ used to initialize newly created object.
* Called everytime the class is instantiated.
* Methods used to prep object being instantistated
are called constructors.
* Instance variables should be defined in __init__ constructor
for consistency.
* Global variables are referred to as class variables.
