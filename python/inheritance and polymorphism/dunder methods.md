# Dunder Methods

One way that we can introduce polymorphism to our class definitions is by using Python’s special dunder methods. We’ve explored a few already, the constructor `__init__` and the string representation method `__repr__`, but that’s only scratching the tip of the iceberg.

Python gives us the power to define dunder methods that define a custom-made class to look and behave like a Python builtin. What does that mean? Say we had a class that has an addition method:

```python
class Color:
  def __init__(self, red, blue, green):
    self.red = red
    self.blue = blue
    self.green = green

  def __repr__(self):
    return "Color with RGB = ({red}, {blue}, {green})".format(red=self.red, blue=self.blue, green=self.green)

  def add(self, other):
    """
    Adds two RGB colors together
    Maximum value is 255
    """
    new_red = min(self.red + other.red, 255)
    new_blue = min(self.blue + other.blue, 255)
    new_green = min(self.green + other.green, 255)

    return Color(new_red, new_blue, new_green)

red = Color(255, 0, 0)
blue = Color(0, 255, 0)

magenta = red.add(blue)
print(magenta)
# Prints "Color with RGB = (255, 255, 0)"
```

In this code we defined a Color class that implements an addition function. Unfortunately, red.add(blue) is a little verbose for something that we have an intuitive symbol for (i.e., the `+` symbol). Well, Python offers the dunder method `__add__` for this very reason! If we rename the `add()` method above to something that looks like this:

```python
class Color:
  def __add__(self, other):
    """
    Adds two RGB colors together
    Maximum value is 255
    """
    new_red = min(self.red + other.red, 255)
    new_blue = min(self.blue + other.blue, 255)
    new_green = min(self.green + other.green, 255)

    return Color(new_red, new_blue, new_green)

Then, if we create the colors:

red = Color(255, 0, 0)
blue = Color(0, 255, 0)
green = Color(0, 0, 255)

We can add them together using the + operator!

# Color with RGB: (255, 255, 0)
magenta = red + blue

# Color with RGB: (0, 255, 255)
cyan = blue + green

# Color with RGB: (255, 0, 255)
yellow = red + green

# Color with RGB: (255, 255, 255)
white = red + blue + green
```

Since we defined an `__add__` method for our Color class, we were able to add these objects together using the + operator.

## Instructions

1. In `script.py` there are two classes defined, Atom and Molecule.

Give Atom a `.__add__(self, other)` method that returns a Molecule with the two Atoms.
