# Review

In this lesson, we learned more complicated relationships between classes. We learned:

* How to create a subclass of an existing class.
* How to redefine existing methods of a parent class in a subclass by overriding them.
* How to leverage a parent class’s methods in the body of a subclass method using the `super()` function.
* How to define a Python exception that inherits from Exception.
* How to write programs that are flexible using interfaces and polymorphism.
* How to write data types that look and feel like native data types with dunder methods.

These are really complicated concepts! It’s a long journey to get to the state of comfortably being able to build class hierarchies that embody the concerns that your software will need to. Give yourself a pat on the back, you earned it!

## Instructions

1. Create a class `SortedList` that inherits from the built-in type list.
2. Recall that lists have a `.append()` method that takes a two arguments, self and value. We’re going to have `SortedList` perform a sort after every `.append()`. Overwrite the append method, leave it blank for now with the pass keyword.
3. First, we want our new `.append()` to actually add the item to the list. Write the code that would get `SortedList` to behave like a normal list when calling the `.append()` method.
4. After you’ve appended the new value, sort the list.
5. Incredible! We subclassed a Python primitive and introduced new behavior to it.

Some things to consider:

* When a `SortedList` gets initialized with unsorted values (say if you call `SortedList([4, 1, 5]))` those values don’t get sorted! How would you change `SortedList` so that the list is sorted right after the object gets created?
* What other Python builtins have functionality “missing”? Could you write a new dictionary that uses a fallback value when it tries to retrieve an item and can’t?
