# Write a function called unique_english_letters that takes the string word as a parameter. 
# The function should return the total number of unique letters in the string. 
# Uppercase and lowercase letters should be counted as different letters.
# Weâ€™ve given you a list of every uppercase and lower case letter in the English alphabet. 
# It will be helpful to include that list in your function.
letters = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
